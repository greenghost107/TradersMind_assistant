# TradersMind Discord Scanner Bot

A Discord bot that monitors Discord channels for stock analysis and provides easy access to the latest analysis when symbols are mentioned in general conversation.

## How It Works

### 🚀 **Startup Initialization**
- Bot automatically scrapes the last 7 days of analysis from both analysis channels
- Builds a map of the latest analysis per stock symbol
- **Ready from first startup** - no need to wait for new analysis messages
- Progress shown during initialization: "📊 Found 15 symbols from last week"

### Analysis Channels (LONG_ANALYSIS_CHANNEL & SHORT_ANALYSIS_CHANNEL)
- The bot monitors these channels for analysis messages
- **Expected message format**: First line contains the stock symbol(s), rest is analysis content
- **Reply messages supported**: Reply messages are indexed with their own content (useful for follow-up analysis)
- **Hebrew & English support**: Full support for Hebrew technical analysis terminology
- **Historical scraping**: Bot reads last week's messages on startup
- Example:
  ```
  AAPL
  Technical analysis shows bullish breakout pattern above $185.
  Price target $210 with support at $180.
  ```
- **Relevance scoring**: Messages must score ≥0.7 to be indexed (filters out ticker-only mentions)
- The bot maintains a map of the latest analysis message URL for each symbol

### General Notices Channel (MANAGER_GENERAL_MESSAGES_CHANNEL)  
- When users post messages with top picks, the bot creates interactive symbol buttons
- **Top Picks Detection**: Automatically parses Hebrew "טופ פיקס" and English "top picks" sections
- **Priority System**: 
  - 🟢 `top_long` - Green buttons for long picks
  - 🔴 `top_short` - Red buttons for short picks  
  - 📊 `regular` - Gray buttons for regular mentions
- **Analysis Filtering**: Only symbols WITH recent analysis get buttons
- **No symbol limit**: All top picks are parsed (no 25-symbol cap) before filtering
- **Message Splitting**: Automatically splits into multiple messages if >20 symbols with analysis
- Users can click symbol buttons to see the latest analysis privately (ephemeral response)
- The response includes a direct link to the most recent analysis message
- **Works immediately** even for historical analysis from before bot startup

## 🔍 Permission Diagnostic System

The bot includes a comprehensive permission diagnostic system that helps identify and troubleshoot Discord permission issues:

### 🚀 **Startup Diagnostics** (Non-blocking)
- **Automatic Execution**: Runs during bot startup without blocking initialization
- **Complete Permission Analysis**: Traces Discord's permission hierarchy step-by-step
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Analyzes all configured channels (analysis + general)
- **Detailed Logging**: Color-coded console output with clear status indicators

### 📊 **Permission Resolution Tracing**
The system traces Discord's complete permission hierarchy:
1. **Server Owner** → All permissions automatically granted
2. **Administrator Role** → All permissions via admin role
3. **@everyone Guild Permissions** → Base server permissions  
4. **Role Permissions** → Additional permissions from assigned roles
5. **Channel @everyone Overrides** → Channel-specific @everyone modifications
6. **Channel Role Overrides** → Channel-specific role permission overrides  
7. **User-Specific Overrides** → Direct user permission overrides

### 🎯 **Critical Permission Monitoring**
Monitors these essential permissions for bot functionality:

**Guild Level:**
- `ViewChannel` - Access to see channels
- `SendMessages` - Send button responses  
- `UseExternalEmojis` - Display emojis in buttons

**Analysis Channels (Read-Only):**
- `ViewChannel` - Access channel content
- `ReadMessageHistory` - Scan historical messages

**General Channel (Write Access):**
- `ViewChannel` - Access channel content
- `SendMessages` - Reply with buttons
- `EmbedLinks` - Rich analysis previews  
- `UseExternalEmojis` - Button emoji labels
- `ReadMessageHistory` - Access message history

### 🔄 **Runtime Monitoring**
- **Error Detection**: Automatically triggers diagnostics on Discord API permission errors
- **Change Detection**: Compares permission states and identifies changes
- **Health Check Integration**: Permission status available via `/health` endpoint
- **Non-disruptive**: Continues bot operation regardless of permission issues

### 📋 **Diagnostic Outputs**

#### Structured Data Export
- **JSON Files**: Exported to `diagnostics/` directory
- **Reproduction Data**: Complete configuration for local testing
- **Latest Report**: Always available as `diagnostics/latest.json`
- **Timestamped Reports**: Historical diagnostic data with timestamps

#### Health Check Endpoint
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "lastChecked": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "accessibleChannels": 3,
    "totalChannels": 3,
    "criticalIssues": 0,
    "warnings": 0
  }
}
```

### 🚨 **Troubleshooting Guide**

**Bot not posting buttons?**
1. Check startup logs for permission status
2. Review `diagnostics/latest.json` for detailed analysis
3. Look for "CRITICAL ISSUES" in console output
4. Verify channel-specific permission overrides

**Common Issues:**
- **Missing UseExternalEmojis**: Buttons won't display emoji correctly
- **Channel Permission Overrides**: @everyone or role overrides blocking access  
- **Missing EmbedLinks**: Analysis previews won't display rich formatting
- **SendMessages Required in Wrong Channel**: Bot only needs SendMessages in general channel, not analysis channels

The diagnostic system ensures you have complete visibility into permission issues without affecting bot performance or reliability.
