# Bot Shutdown Cleanup Testing

This document explains how to test the bot's message cleanup functionality when receiving a SIGINT signal (Ctrl+C).

## Test Overview

The `bot-shutdown-cleanup.spec.ts` test verifies that:
1. ‚úÖ Bot starts successfully with mocked Discord components
2. ‚úÖ Mock button messages are created (simulating bot responses)
3. ‚úÖ SIGINT signal triggers graceful shutdown
4. ‚úÖ Bot logs show cleanup attempt during shutdown
5. ‚úÖ Bot process exits cleanly with code 0

## Prerequisites

1. **Built Bot**: Run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript
2. **No external dependencies**: Test uses mocks, no real Discord connection needed

## Setup

1. **Build the bot**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **No environment setup needed**: Test uses mocked Discord components

## Running the Test

### Quick Test
```bash
npm run test:shutdown
```

### Verbose Output
```bash
npx playwright test bot-shutdown-cleanup.spec.ts --workers=1
```

## What the Test Does

### Step 1: Mock Setup
- Creates mock Discord channel and client components
- Creates mock bot messages with button components
- No real Discord connection required

### Step 2: Bot Startup
- Spawns the actual bot process using `node dist/bot.js`
- Uses mocked Discord token and channel IDs
- Waits for "is online and ready!" log message
- Captures all bot stdout/stderr for debugging

### Step 3: SIGINT Signal
- Sends `SIGINT` signal to bot process (equivalent to Ctrl+C)
- Bot should start graceful shutdown sequence
- Logs all shutdown activity

### Step 4: Verification
- Waits for bot process to exit
- Analyzes bot logs for expected cleanup messages
- Verifies bot attempted to call cleanup methods
- Confirms bot exited with code 0 (success)

## Expected Logs

When working correctly, you should see:
```
Created 2 mock bot messages with buttons
BOT: TestBot#1234 is online and ready!
2/2 messages exist before shutdown
Sending SIGINT to bot process...
BOT: Shutting down bot...
BOT: üîç DEBUG: Entered shutdown method
BOT: ‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO: Initiating graceful shutdown...
BOT: üßπ Performing final cleanup before shutdown...
BOT: üßπ Clearing all bot button messages...
BOT: ‚úÖ Final cleanup complete
BOT: ‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO: Bot shutdown complete
Bot process exited with code: 0
‚úÖ Found expected log: "Shutting down bot"
‚úÖ Found expected log: "Performing final cleanup"  
‚úÖ Found expected log: "Clearing all bot button messages"
Found 3/3 expected cleanup logs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't start
- Ensure `npm run build` was run
- Check Discord token is valid
- Verify channel IDs are correct

### No button messages created
- Check if your test message matches expected format
- Verify bot has permissions in test channel
- Look for "DEBUG: Creating single button message" log

### Messages not deleted
- Check for "üßπ Performing final cleanup" logs
- Verify no errors in shutdown sequence
- Ensure bot has delete message permissions

### Test timeout
- Increase timeout values in test if network is slow
- Check bot logs for stuck processes
- Verify Discord API connectivity

## Integration with CI/CD

To run in automated environments:
```bash
# Set environment variables and run
export DISCORD_TOKEN="$TEST_BOT_TOKEN"
export TEST_CHANNEL_ID="$TEST_CHANNEL_ID" 
export TEST_MANAGER_ID="$TEST_MANAGER_ID"
npm run build && npm run test:shutdown
```

This test provides confidence that the bot properly cleans up its messages when shut down gracefully.
